In this assignment I created small automation framework. I tried to keep it short and understandable.
For sure we could add more reusable code, less hardcore, allure steps, but I decided to keep it smaller due of lack of time.
Folders:

base contains:
-- base_elements: Base with common methods for work with web elements
-- base_page: Base Page with common methods for work with web page


data:
-- locators: selenium xpath locators we need through our testing
-- resources: data we can put for reusability


documentation:
-- manual_cases: all tests cases I created for given software. Mostly I tried to create regression tests.


game_pages:
-- roulette: this folder can contain a lot of different pages


tests:
-- conftest
-- tests


In manual tests documentation I added in description which tests I automated. They can be found by number (e.g Test Case 1,
Test Case 2). Also in description of this tests I added which tests I would like to automate if I had more time. And for sure
I would make my manual tests more detailed.

Reliability tests I would automate only in Jmeter. Or similar tool.
Security testing I would automate, but I would not run it every CI. I would run them in case some libraries were updated.
Or approximately once a week.
From exactly roulette part, would be hard to automate rolling part with selenium.

I hope everything was understandable.
Have a great day!

P.S I am so sorry, in the last moment I realized (could not check it before because of only one commit) that I did
most of work in codeaimoonrail directory. Not in ilona-solomakha-RpjX-roulette-automation-iL4i.
So right now permissions doesn't work. Please, move my files to codeaimoonrail directory and my tests will work.
So sorry, had only 6 minutes to fix!
